    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Who can use CBAB?</h3>
    <p>CBAB is intended to be an open share database free to use for everybody interested in
        cremation burials dating to the European Bronze Age.</p>

    <h3>What can you do without a CBAB-Account?</h3>
    <p>You can browse the data for basic information on burial sites (location, number of burials,
        literature, scientists in charge of the material, etc.), specific burials (eg. Grave 15 in
        Franzhausen-Kokoron, Austria) and create maps for e.g. talks or papers.</p>

    <h3>What can you do with a CBAB-Account?</h3>
    <p>Furthermore you have the opportunity to make enquiries about certain data e.g. burial
        features like grave types combined with anthropological data or grave goods. In order to use
        this service you need an account that gives you full access to the CBAB-Database.<br/>With
        this account you can not only customise your enquiries but also create burial sites and
        burials in the database yourself.</p>

    <h3>Why should I enter data?</h3>
    <p>Because more data available in CBAB will give you and others more research options, better
        enquiry results, more accurate mappings and bring your own work in front of a bigger
        audience.</p>

    <h3>What to enter in the CBAB-Database?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>any cremation burial you like, if it is a (potential) Bronze Age grave</li>
        <li>any archaeological site including excavated Bronze Age cremation burials</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If only part of a cemetery was excavated, you can create a new <b>Burial Site</b> and enter
        the excavated cremations (see <a href="#section1">How to create a <b>Burial
        Site</b>?</a>)</p>

    <h3>What not to enter in the CBAB-Database?</h3>
    <ul><li>any inhumation grave or cremation burials from other periods e.g. Early Bronze Age or
            Iron Age</li> If such graves appear within a (biritual) cemetery that provide Bronze Age
        cremation burials, you can mention them in a textbox implemented in the <b>Burial Site</b>
        form (see <a href="#section1">How to create a <b>Burial Site</b>?</a>) <li>any features only
            known from archaeological surveys</li></ul>

    <p>The CBAB-Database asks for very detailed information on Bronze Age cremation burials in order
        to provide researchers with detailed information on this specific burial form. Therefore
        CBAB demands <u>excavated</u> burials to maximize the knowledge on cremations.</p>

    <h3>How to enter data in CBAB?</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>ask for an account to be able to curate data</li>
        <li>check if the literature you want to quote is already in the CBAB-Zotero database;<br/>if
            not please contact the database-team, who will put it in Zotero for you</li>
        <li>create the burial site</li>
        <li>from the location you can start to curate a burial</li>
        <li>from the burial you can enter more specific information on e.g. the urn vessel, grave
            goods, anthropological results, etc.</li>
    </ol>

        <p><b>Latitude</b> and <b>Longitude</b> are both mandatory for creating a burial site.<br/>

            <h3>How to enter Animal Remains</h3>
            <p>There are two different ways to create an <b>Animal Remains</b>.</p>
            <ol type="A">
                <li>First you have to create a burial (see above <a href="#section5">How to create a
                        Burial</a>).</li>
                <p>On the general page of the burial there is the category <b>Create objects in this
                        Burial</b> where you choose the button <b>Animal Remains Goods (continue
                        with C)</b>. Since this is the easier way, we highly recommend using this
                    method! By following it you cannot mix up the burials.</p>
                <div class="thumbnail">
                    <a href="{% static 'webpage/img/manual/resource54.png' %}"

                            style="width:50%"/></a></div>
                <li>Caution: Using method <b>B)</b> means you have first to pick the burial and urn
                    from the list provided in <b>Burial</b> and <b>Urn</b> on top of the page. The
                    list features <u>every burial and every urn</u> in the database!</li>
                <p>Go to <b>Curate and Browse the Data</b> and choose <b>Animal Remain</b>.<br/>This
                    brings you to the page <b>All Animal Remains</b>, where you can use the button
                        <b>Create New Animal Remains</b>.</p><div class="thumbnail">

                <p>You will be directed to <b>Create/Edit Animal Remains</b>. First two fields are
                        <b>Burial</b> and <b>Urn</b>. Here you must choose a specific Burial/Urn
                    which correlates to the Animal Remains you are entering! </p>
                <p>After that you can proceed with the Animal Remains properties (Age, Sex
                    etc.).</p>

                    number mentioned in the catalogue/excavation documentation or the body side
                    being reflected in the animal remains). <br/>Caution: <b>Age</b> and <b>Sex</b>
                    are rarely analysed. If you do not have any information on this, just leave the
